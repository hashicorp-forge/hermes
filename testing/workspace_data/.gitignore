# Git tracking for testing/workspace_data
#
# Strategy: Track seed data (templates), ignore runtime data
#
# ✅ Tracked (committed to git):
#   - templates/      Template documents for document creation
#   - README.md       Documentation
#
# ❌ Ignored (runtime data):
#   - docs/          Published documents (created at runtime)
#   - drafts/        Draft documents (created at runtime)
#   - folders/       Folder metadata (created at runtime)
#   - users/         User profiles (created at runtime, except users.json in parent)
#   - tokens/        Auth tokens (created at runtime)

# Ignore all runtime directories
/docs/
/drafts/
/folders/
/users/
/tokens/

# Keep templates (tracked)
!/templates/
!/templates/**

# Keep documentation
!README.md
