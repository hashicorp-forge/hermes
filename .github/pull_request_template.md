**DELETE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**

In the short term, there are several large changes planned for the Hermes project.
Before submitting a pull request we request that you submit a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp-forge/hermes/issues/new) first
so maintainers can validate the change you may want to propose. This is to make sure
there aren’t any conflicts with the upcoming plans for the project. As the
project becomes more stable over the next several releases, we think it
will become much easier to contribute.

If your PR resolves any open issue(s), please indicate them like this so they will be closed when your PR is merged:
